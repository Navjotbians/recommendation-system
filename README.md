# Recommender System 

We all are influenced by the recommender system to different degrees, if we are using social media, making an online purchase or consuming content from streaming platforms. Recommender systems engage the user by providing them with personalized choices based on their past behaviour. 
<br>
It’s a very hot topic in e-commerce, it has changed the way we sell things, we have unlimited inventory, the products we previously neglected in the stores are assessable to the customers now online. <br>
Under the hood, a recommender system is a learning algorithm that learns from past preferences to predict the future behaviour of the user.<br>
Some example from real-life are: Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, Spotify, OkCupid, New York Times, GitHub, Medical (Facilitating clinical decision making)


### Motivation
Now customer’s mindset is - 

***“I want a black T-shirt! There must be four different fits of five brands in four different fabrics on this website! Choices are good! I know!  Let me quit my job and devote my life to choosing a Black T-shirt! I will compare the fabric! I will compare the brands! I will check if their sizes are true to the fit and I will compare the prices! Maybe I will check on other websites and see what they have to offer! “***

Offering a plethora of selection options doesn’t necessarily mean a customer will buy more stuff. More options do attract customers but they get lost with the options and lose their motivation to make a purchase.  Instead, when providing with personalized options, chances are high that customer will buy the product.  Recommender system provides personalized recommendations that ease the heavy load of choices by reducing the search space and identifying the most relevant and quality product for the user. 


### Goal
To build a Recommender system capable of making recommendations in a sensible way.
